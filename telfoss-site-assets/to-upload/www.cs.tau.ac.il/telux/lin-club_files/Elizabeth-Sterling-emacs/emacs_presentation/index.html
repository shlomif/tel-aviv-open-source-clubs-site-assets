<h1>Getting Started With Emacs</h1>

<p>Pick a nice, lazy afternoon. Snuggle up on the couch with your linux laptop. Open up emacs and type 'C-h t'. This will take you through the Emacs tutorial, and by the end of it you may well be hooked for life.</p>

<p>Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time display editor. You can make Emacs into the exact tool that you want for whatever it is you do with it. Whether you use Emacs from programming, hypermedia, journaling, games, email, news reading, or any one of a dozen other possibilities, you can adjust every piece to fit your own preferences.</p>

<p>With emacs you can build your own key bindings for commonly used programming tasks, or use the major and minor modes that others have already created. You can write directly to your blog from Emacs. You can connect to external servers and edit files directly on them  You can use cvs or svn directly in emacs.</p>

<p>We'll only be talking about a small portion of the things that you can do with emacs. This is a super begining introduction to emacs. If you are interested in learning more about specific tasks in Emacs, let me know and I'll gladly put together a targeted presentation to meet the needs of the group.</p>
